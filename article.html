    <h2>
        I Wrote 47 Viral Articles With This Secret Research Method<br>
        <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #555; font-weight: normal;">The exact 7-step system that took me from zero views to thousands of readers in under 12 months</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
        I used to stare at my blank screen for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing came out. The cursor just blinked at me, almost laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’d check what other writers were doing, copy their methods, and still fail.
    </p>
    <p>
        My articles got lost in the internet graveyard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then I stumbled onto a research method that changed everything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not from a course or a guru. It came from my own failures and a crazy idea I had at 3 AM.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the past 12 months, this method helped me create 47 articles that went viral. Not just a few shares, but thousands of views.
    </p>
    <p>
        This isn’t your typical “10 tips for better research” post.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m going to show you exactly what I do, step by step, with real examples from my own work.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why Most Topic Research Methods Fail</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Most writers do one of three things:
    </p>
    <p>
        They copy what’s already popular
    </p>
    <p>
        They guess what people want
    </p>
    <p>
        They write what they personally find interesting
    </p>
    <p>
        None of these work consistently.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here’s why:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Popular topics are already covered by bigger websites with more authority. When you copy them, you’re always playing catch-up.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Guessing what people want leads to articles nobody searches for.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Writing only what interests you might feel good, but it doesn’t guarantee readers.
    </p>
    <p>
        My method fixes all these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The 7-Layer Research Method</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of topic research as digging for treasure. Most people scratch the surface and find nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to dig through seven layers to find gold.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Layer 1: Pain Point Mining</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        People read articles to solve problems. The bigger the problem, the more they want a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here’s how I find real pain points:
    </p>
    <p>
        I hang out in Reddit communities related to my topic
    </p>
    <p>
        I read comments, not just posts
    </p>
    <p>
        I look for phrases like “I can’t figure out,” “I’m struggling with,” or “How do I”
    </p>
    <p>
        I save these questions in a spreadsheet
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Example: When researching productivity topics, I found dozens of comments like “I make to-do lists but never finish them” and “I start projects but can’t complete them.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        This became my article “Why Your Brain Sabotages Your To-Do List (And How to Fix It)” which got 37,000 views on Medium.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Layer 2: Competitive Gap Analysis</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This step sounds fancy but it’s simple:
    </p>
    <p>
        Find the top 10 articles on your topic
    </p>
    <p>
        List what they cover
    </p>
    <p>
        Look for what they all miss
    </p>
    <p>
        I use a simple table with article titles on top and subtopics on the side.
    </p>
    <p>
        I mark which articles cover which subtopics. Anything with few checkmarks is a gap.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Example: I noticed fitness articles about home workouts all focused on exercises but ignored how to stay motivated without a gym environment.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        My article “The Psychological Tricks That Make Home Workouts Actually Stick” filled this gap and went viral during the pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Layer 3: Trend Timing</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Topics have seasons. Knowing when interest peaks helps your article hit at the perfect time.
    </p>
    <p>
        I use Google Trends but in a specific way:
    </p>
    <p>
        Check the five-year view to spot yearly patterns
    </p>
    <p>
        Look for topics trending upward
    </p>
    <p>
        Plan to publish 2–3 weeks before peak interest
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Example: I noticed searches for “how to sleep better” spike in January and August. I published sleep articles in mid-December and mid-July, which positioned them perfectly for the rush of searchers.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Layer 4: Comment Mining for Language</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The words people use matter. I collect the exact phrases people use when talking about their problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I take screenshots of comments from:
    </p>
    <p>
        YouTube videos on my topic
    </p>
    <p>
        Amazon reviews of related products
    </p>
    <p>
        Facebook groups
    </p>
    <p>
        Twitter/X discussions
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve built a “language bank” of real phrases people use about different topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Example: For a money-saving article, I noticed people rarely said “I want to budget better” but often said, “I need to stop bleeding money.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Using their language in my headlines and intros doubled my click rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Layer 5: Contrarian Angle Finding</strong><br>
        For any popular belief, there’s a group of people who have found it doesn’t work for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        To find contrarian angles:
    </p>
    <p>
        List common advice on your topic
    </p>
    <p>
        Search for “why [common advice] doesn’t work”
    </p>
    <p>
        Read the stories of people who tried and failed
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Example: Everyone says “wake up at 5 AM to be successful.” I found hundreds of night owls who tried this and crashed.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        My article “Why Waking Up at 5 AM Destroyed My Productivity (And What Actually Worked)” resonated with this underserved audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Layer 6: Problem Stacking</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Most articles solve one problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Viral articles solve multiple connected problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I list related problems and stack them in one article:
    </p>
    <p>
        Main problem → Related problem → Deeper problem
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Example: Instead of just writing “How to Meal Prep,” I wrote “How to Meal Prep When You Hate Cooking, Have No Time, and Get Bored Easily.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        This addressed three stacked problems and outperformed basic meal prep articles by 5x.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Layer 7: Headline Testing</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before writing a single word of the article, I test 5–10 headline ideas:
    </p>
    <p>
        I post headline options in relevant Facebook groups asking which they’d click
    </p>
    <p>
        I create simple Twitter/X polls
    </p>
    <p>
        I ask 3–5 friends which headline makes them most curious
    </p>
    <p>
        I only write articles with headlines that get strong positive reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Example: For a productivity article, I tested:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        “10 Productivity Hacks for Busy People”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Why Your Productivity System Is Making You Less Productive”
    </p>
    <p>
        “The Post-It Note Method That Doubled My Daily Output”
    </p>
    <p>
        The third one got 3x more interest in testing and became my most shared article that month.
